# Miracle theme for yakuake

A working minimalistic theme for yakuake in black with a coloured line for active tab.

## Background

First I wanted a transparent (85 %) black background. That's how I configure my profile as well. But I found out
that the tab bar has always a black background even when all pictures are 100% transparent. So I changed my mind
and made a complete black layout. Maybe I will change to a greenish dark grey in the future.

## Workaround

Many themes are broken on my machine (gnome 3.x) and I found out why: the theme needs a 100% transparent pixel in
the very right end. I don't know why but otherwise it's just not showing about 20% of the window (including all
the buttons and the terminal itself).

## Icons

The lock icon, the cog icon and the close icon are taken from material icons. Thanks to the contributors!
